            Kendrick have a dream. I am a sinner who's probably going to sin again. Playstation and some drank. Technology bought
            my soul. Got me breathing with dragons. I crack the eggs in your basket. I'm Marilyn Manson with madness, now just
            imagine the magic. Start up that Maserati and 'Vroom! Vroom' I'm racing. I got 25 lighters on my dresser. I can
            feel your energy from two planets away. I got my drink, I got my music. I would share them both today. I can feel
            the changes. I can feel the people around me just want to be famous.

      <div class="content">2 chainz, four bracelets. All I get is cheese, like I'm taking pictures. Tupac without a nose ring. Thug life: one
        wife, a mistress and a girlfriend. When I die, bury me inside the Gucci store. Pull up to the scene with my ceiling
        missing. Might valet park a Brinks truck. Let's play big bank take little bank. You are looking at a shark in a fish
        tank. Crocodile, the gator type. I'm allergic to the hater type. Where's Paris Hilton? Where's Kat Stacks? I'm Rambo
        with this ammunition, my camo came from Tru Religion. My Boost Mobile chirping, it might be my amigo. Dreads hang
        on designer everything, Mr. Comme des Gar√ßons, Mr. Alexander Wang. And I'm known to kick it like the captain of a
        soccer team. And I ain't crazy but if that's my baby then we gonna have to name that little baby Mercedes. I be laughing
        to the bank all you do is giggle. If you know me, then you know I've been thinking Franklin, money, thousands, Tru
        Religion trousers. Catch up to my campaign, coupe the color of mayonnaise. Rain, pourin. All my cars is foreign.
        All my broads is foreign. Money tall like Jordan. Got a private home started from the public houses. This that sauce,
        this that dressing. Hair weave killer causing her arousal. Audi A8, told em, outtie 5000.
